This diagram represents the structure of the travel information application developed for DFCorp. Here's an explanation of each component:

App: This is the main component of the application, serving as the entry point. It orchestrates the rendering of other components and manages the application's global state.

Header: The header component contains elements such as the logo, navigation menu, and possibly user authentication features.

Routes: Responsible for handling navigation within the application. It determines which component to render based on the current URL.

SearchBar: This component allows users to input a location they want to get weather information about. It's located at the top of the homepage for easy access.

HomePage: The landing page of the application where users are initially directed. It contains the search bar and may display additional information or prompts.

WeatherPage: Upon selecting a location from the search bar, users are directed to the WeatherPage, which displays the 5-day weather forecast for the chosen location. This page also includes functionality to add the location to favourites.

FavouritePlaces: Stores the list of favorite locations. Users can save locations they frequently check the weather for, and this component manages the persistence of these favourites locally.

AddToFavorites: A component responsible for adding a location to the list of favorite places. It's likely a button or action that users can trigger while viewing weather information on the WeatherPage.

This structure ensures that the application remains modular and scalable. Each component has a specific responsibility, making the codebase easier to manage and maintain. Additionally, the routing mechanism ensures seamless navigation between different views of the application.
